# Task: create basic structure of HTML
## HTML template
* Define doctype using ```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
* Set language using 
```html
<html lang="en-US"></html>
```
* Add more tags 
```html
<title></title>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" type="text.css">
```
* As I found out trying to do the week 3 activity my link to the stylesheet didn't work properly, I found a fix online which involves importing it into the HTML instead of linking it normally
```html
<style>
		@import url("css/images.css");
</style>
```
* Add body tags and close HTML tag
* Full template at [[HTML template]]
	* Will be used frequently throughout the course I think
## HTML structure
* wire frame image here is really interesting, helped me understand how elements are nested within each other
