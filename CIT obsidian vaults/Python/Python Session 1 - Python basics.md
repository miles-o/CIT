- Python is a high-level platform independent programming language\
	- A high-level programming language is designed to be read by humans
	- Platform independent means it can be run on various operating systems
- Python, like java, uses a virtual machine to run and compile code like explained in [[Java Session 1 - Introduction]] 
- Indentation is important in python
	- python uses indentation to mark blocks of code, similar to how {} work in java
	- most other languages do not need indentation to work but python does
- Python literals are just constants
	- don't know why they call them literals instead of constants
	- just remember lol
