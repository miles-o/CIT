To whom it may concern,

I have a few questions on the specification for the animal management program we are making for your organisation. 
1. It has only been specified that when modifying an animals details, the ID, vet, or fees will need to be able to be changed. Are there any more details that you would like to be able to modify? For example if someone makes a mistake when entering the animal into the system. 
2. Would you like to be able to modify vet details within the system?
3. It has not been specified that animals will be able to be removed from the system, would you like to add that functionality?
4. Do you shelter animals yourselves, or are all animals sheltered in vets that you work with? 
5. How should age be measured for animals? e.g. weeks, months, years
6. Would you like the age to change as the animal gets older?
